## Remap your Power key

PowerKey remaps your Apple MacBook, MacBook Pro or MacBook Air's Power key.

Remapping the Power key to Forward Delete ⌦ is the most popular replacement.

PowerKey can also be used to run a Script or Apple Script each time you tap the Power Key.

## Forward Delete for Mac OS X

The Forward Delete key is extremely convenient when writing or coding, and you're probably already used to tapping it frequently on keyboards other than your MacBook's.

Use PowerKey to restore useful functionality to your Macbook's keyboard!

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### Pressing the Power key doesn't always work.

Apple has made mode-switching keys such as Caps-Lock and Power somewhat harder to accidentally press:

 > [Mac Notebooks: Caps Lock modified to reduce accidental activation](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1192)

You must *firmly* press the key for half-a-tick longer than a normal keypress for it to be recognized.

#### The display is turning off!

PowerKey doesn't modify the behavior of *holding* the power key.

Depending on how long you hold the power key, this may result in your display turning off, the computer going to sleep, or a forced shutdown.

When using PowerKey, be sure to only press the power key with a firm, hard tap.

#### But my MacBook has an Eject key!

The Eject key has been replaced by a Power key on the newer Macbook, Macbook Pro, and Macbook Air models that do not feature an optical drive.

But PowerKey **does** work with the Eject key as well, so you're in luck.

Your laptop's metal Power button (in the chassis) will actually work with this app as well, but it's up to you to decide if that's desirable.

#### I'm using OS X 10.9 Mavericks, and my Mac immediately goes to Sleep.

In OS X 10.9 Mavericks, tapping the power key *immediately* puts the computer to sleep.

This behavior has been corrected in later versions of OS X, so please take the time to upgrade from Mavericks if possible.

If using Mavericks, you will need to run an additional command to enable PowerKey. Please see [Issue #14](https://github.com/pkamb/PowerKey/issues/14) for more information.
